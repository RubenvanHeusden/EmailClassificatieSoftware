Advanced Models
***************

Although the TF-IDF model is a nice and simple model, there might be cases
when you would want to use a more advanced method, such as a CNN, LSTM or even a 
BERT model. This short guide provides an overview of some of these models with some examples
on using them and general usage guidelines. 
For the CNN model and Bidirectional LSTM model it should be sufficient to inspect the examples in 
the 'examples' folder as they follow the exact same structure and support (allmost) all the same method 
calls as the TF-IDF classifier. Because the BERT and Multigate model are somewhat different
they are explained in a bit more detailed here, although you can also simply look at the 'examples' folder
if you are already more familiar with these models.
