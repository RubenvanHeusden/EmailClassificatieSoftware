Documentation of the EmailClassificatieSoftware package
=======================================================

Hello! This is the documentation for the 'EmailClassificatieSoftware' package for 
Dutch Text Classification (the research accompanying this package was focussed on email classification).
This package contains several often-used and state-of-the-art models for text classification, which can
be trained on Dutch text. It also contains some utility classes and functions that can be used for preparing
and anonymizing training data. For the neural networks using word embeddings, the word embeddings developed for 
Dutch by Stephan Tulkens and Chris Emmery and Walter Daelemans :cite:`tulkens2016evaluating` in are used.
